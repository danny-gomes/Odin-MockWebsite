# HiddenLink

Flexbox project from The Odin Project.

## What I used

1. HTML
2. CSS - Flexbox
3. Git

## What I learned

Got good practice in writing HTML and using CSS, flexbox specifically. Using <a> tags as buttons was also a nice little trick I found online.
Did my best to come up with my own concept for the mock website, not sure if it was any good though, feel like the idea could've been better, anyway, was fun.
